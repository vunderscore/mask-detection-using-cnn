# mask-detection-using-cnn
a mask detection Deep learning model on tensorflow using CNN

The notebook files depict how the model was made using the cnn, Check both the nootebook(ipynb) files to know the making of the model

The other files are based on how to load and use the model. The application uses opencv to get the video frames for your system's camera and
applies the model to each frame. The modified code can detect when a mask is present and send the picture and a short video clip to the 
directory of your choice.
